    <string name="information"> The purpose of zakat, one of Islam five pillars, is to cleanse the wealth of those who pay it as well as to redistribute it between the rich and the needy. Estimating zakat payment for gold savings is what is meant by zakat. Users of this application have the option to select between wear and keep gold. The amount of zakat will be computed using the total value of the gold, the amount of zakat that is payable, and uruf. Users of this application have also benefited from the application ability to calculate zakat amounts automatically, which makes it simpler to pay zakat without being confused.</string>
